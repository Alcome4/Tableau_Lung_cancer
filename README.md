### Problem Understanding
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While the majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking, emerging research highlights that exposure to air pollution is also a significant risk factor. A recent study found that air pollution may increase the risk of lung cancer, even among nonsmokers. Understanding these contributing factors is critical for early prevention and improving lung health outcomes.
### Motivation
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased concern about respiratory health. COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, and this has brought greater attention to factors that contribute to lung diseases. Identifying the key risk factors and symptoms that impact lung health can help in maintaining better respiratory health and potentially reduce the risk of developing conditions like lung cancer.
### Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:
- **Age**: The age of the patient (Numeric)
- **Gender**: The gender of the patient (Categorical)
- **Air Pollution**: The level of air pollution exposure of the patient (Categorical)
- **Alcohol Use**: The level of alcohol use of the patient (Categorical)
- **Dust Allergy**: The level of dust allergy of the patient (Categorical)
- **Occupational Hazards**: The level of occupational hazards faced by the patient (Categorical)
- **Genetic Risk**: The level of genetic predisposition to lung cancer (Categorical)
- **Chronic Lung Disease**: The level of chronic lung disease in the patient (Categorical)
- **Balanced Diet**: Whether the patient follows a balanced diet (Categorical)
- **Obesity**: The level of obesity in the patient (Categorical)
- **Smoking**: The level of smoking by the patient (Categorical)
- **Passive Smoker**: Whether the patient is exposed to secondhand smoke (Categorical)
- **Chest Pain**: The level of chest pain experienced by the patient (Categorical)
- **Coughing of Blood**: Whether the patient coughs up blood (Categorical)
- **Fatigue**: The level of fatigue experienced by the patient (Categorical)
- **Weight Loss**: Whether the patient has experienced significant weight loss (Categorical)
- **Shortness of Breath**: Whether the patient experiences shortness of breath (Categorical)
- **Wheezing**: Whether the patient experiences wheezing (Categorical)
- **Swallowing Difficulty**: Whether the patient has difficulty swallowing (Categorical)
- **Clubbing of Finger Nails**: Whether the patient has clubbing of the fingernails (Categorical)
### Problem Questions
- What are the key risk factors for lung cancer?
- What symptoms are most closely associated with lung cancer?
- Which age group shows the highest incidence of lung cancer?
### Conclusion
Our visualizations provided several key insights:
- A significant number of lung cancer cases were observed in the age group 35-40.
- The most prominent risk factors identified were smoking, occupational hazards, and air pollution.
- The most common symptoms associated with lung cancer include coughing up blood, fatigue, chest pain, and chronic lung disease.
These findings suggest that a combination of lifestyle factors, such as smoking and exposure to air pollution, along with symptoms like chronic chest pain and coughing blood, are strong indicators of possible lung cancer. Early detection and management of these risk factors and symptoms can play a critical role in lung cancer prevention and treatment.
